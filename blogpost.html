<h1>First narritave: the road of Technology</h1>

<p>Let’s face it folks times are changing, and fast. This is the future whether we like it or not. The world we knew in the past or whatever we felt comfortable with is gone, and guess what here kiddies it ain’t coming back. Regardless if we like it or not technology is going to play a critical role in everyone’s life, and it has always been that way. In my youth in the 2000s I grew up in a working class family that wasn’t up to or interested in keeping up with what the latest of the technological market had to offer. I never put my hands on a computer of any sort until I started Kindergarten in 2005. My earliest uses of computers where typing programs for little children and the River deep math program using Dell and Gateway badge PC’s running on Windows 2000. I used a web browser the first time in first or second grade and it was Internet Explorer crap edition. At home, it was not until 2011 August that I had a PC and it was an eight-year-old virus riddled Hewlett Packard tower that ran as fast as a turtle that was handed down by an old and dying relative. I was in a faze when I was a preteen I was a big fan of everything 50s-60s-and 70s and was disenfranchised by the direction of then popular culture and the ways of the majority of my peers. During this time I became a luddite and had no interest in the modern world, to such extent I didn’t know how to turn on a laptop or let alone navigate it when I was in sixth grade. I looked at technology as the enemy of the benefit of mankind, as something that was enslaving it and served in a position as a detriment and didn't make sense to me why everything was being centralized. It was in the past couple of years while I was waking up to the problems of the world that I saw where technology shines. Never in human history have people been able to find a catalog of all sorts of information about any given topic they like. That to me is what the WWW is all about, it is a network of zeros and ones but it is a place where people like me can do something and reach all sorts of people without physical or political boundaries. Even as the big conglomerates make moves to centralize and standardize the place and turn it into a dull redundant controlled shadow of itself. Then of course we see the trailblazers of our era create alternatives to the norm, places that allow individuals to speak beyond the lines of established convention. With the uproar of society in 2020 these decentralized establishments became the epicenters of thought and reason in a way I thought ten years ago was a lost art. With the rise of places likes Discord and Zoom independent content creators create full communities and have 24/7 communication with the audience and gave a place for people to congregate and meet new people with a like mind and share similar interests in places around the world, with the reality being that this feat would have been total absurdity at any time in history prior to this point. This all came full circle for me last October when I joined the Grand Theft World community. My life has changed in an unmeasurable manner and lead me on a course for me to get to meet people out in the world with a variety of different backgrounds, skills, views and native tongues. I t is an unbelievable gift that I cherish every day and is something I would have never thought would ever be possible in my lifetime. Today I have decided to become a content creator and host a community of people of varying different backgrounds, interests, skills, views, etc. My view is that technology is not a factor that has any virtue as tools are an extension of man. There for a tool will be action on the accord of the man in control of it. We can allow technology is reign over us, or we can reign supremacy over it. Preferably I would be in control of it.</p>

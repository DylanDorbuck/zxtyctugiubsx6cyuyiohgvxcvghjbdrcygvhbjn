  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>On this site, I will be constructing blogs revolving around relevent subject matter that I see fit for publicizing. I will add my knowledge and purspective to it that make it unique to anything being oublished by anyone else in the world. I
    wanted to do some kind of editorial of some sort for quite a long time. I saw this during the time that I was exploring technical knowledge as the perfect time to pull the trigger on that. I also think that I have an audience that has interest in
    what I have to say about certain things. The question that I have now is what genres are people interested in my writing about? I have some ideas in mind and I know some issues I will bring forth but what I would like to write shit about certain
    topics out there my audience is interested in hearing my position on, of course in my unique and provocative style. Any suggestions report them to the Discord chat.</p>
